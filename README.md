cat (chemistry and thermal transport app)
=====

Fork "cat" to create a new MOOSE-based application.

For more information see: [https://mooseframework.org/getting_started/new_users.html#create-an-app](https://mooseframework.org/getting_started/new_users.html#create-an-app)

This app coupled thermal transport, thermal decomposition kinetics, and mechanics for RDX-based PBXs with an atomistic-aware subgrid model called MISTERnet
